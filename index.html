            <summary>My Childhood</summary>
I was born in West Virginia, but my family moved away from there when I was very young.  We lived in Texas for several years, then moved to Indiana.  I stayed in Indiana for most of my life before moving to Michigan for a year. Then I finally came to the Houston area and have been here ever since.
